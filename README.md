I am learning how Git and Github work along with integrating VS code with git as well and I feel as if I messed things up.
This will be the end of this repository and I will start again and work on learning how these things work with one another.

* I didn't understand how branches worked and how they interacted with your code and opened and then closed them without actually doing anything with them. 
* Branches are a way to work on specific parts of a project in an enclosed environment so that you do not break the main code.
* This is extremely helpful for groups and individuals so you can have different sections you work on and play with how the code will work without worry. 
* As for how git I am still not sure on how that works but to my small understanding it is a program that will link your code editor to github so you can share and code
  with the public.
* I kno that it may seem weird that I am abandoning this repository now but I would like to understand a little more on how this works so I have a very clear example
  of how all these processes work with one another and having a messy example will not build good habits when learning.
  
  I hope whoever come across this can learn from my mistakes and we can learn together sometime. I know this is a really diffcult path and can be alot of work but
  thankfully there is always something of substance created out of this work. You will make so manythings and that is amazing!
